### Learnings after breaking up with my cofounder

A few weeks ago, I joined [Antler](https://www.antler.co/), a pre-seed/pre-idea start up accelerator based on Paris.

It’s a 3 months cohort where the main idea is to group up and start building companies together.

For me, it was an amazing idea. I’ve never found a cofounder so I group up and started a company together.

That’s how I found my cofounder.

It was a 5 weeks process of discovering things together.

Unfortunately, the relationship did not work. But the process lead me to the following learnings:

- _A CTO can also been a CEO_. I’ve always considered myself a tech guy. How ever, while building a product in a sector that I have experience and I am very passionate about (education), there is a gut feeling that just tells you where to go. Listen to it. Don’t debate. [Product CEO](https://www.yellowfinbi.com/blog/your-ceo-must-be-product-person#:~:text=A%20product%20CEO%20is%20someone,along%20with%20their%20product%20strategy.) is called.
- _Chemistry is not enough, complementary skills it’s what matters_. With my co founder, we both had a very strong vision on where we wanted this company to go. Which lead to continuous arguments (and blockers) and what steps to take next.
- _Building > Customer Interviews_. One or two customer interviews are ok to understand an industry processes. But after each interview there is this 3 second silence: _“Then what?”_. This is where you should have something to show. Measure interest from there.
- _Finding urgent needs_. Having a product that is a “nice to have” will lead to zero sales. Finding that needs to be fixed/done right now is what will bring you from 0 to 1. i.e. We focused on corporate upskilling learning. Companies want their employees to learn new stuff right? Is it urgent? Is it a business priority? Then, the story is different.
- _Group learning is the key_. I’ve always struggled with discipline to keep building. But when I found a cohort building the same stuff as me, it just worked. I woke up in the morning, went to the office and started working. _It just worked_. Even if you are solo. You are not alone.

So what’s next?

Keep building things.

I am tired of taking to customers to see what they need.

I want to have some assumptions and build something fast, test, take what it works and discard the rest.

Start Up way the say
