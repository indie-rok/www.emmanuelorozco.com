I am a natural worrier. If she does not text back or people are not reacting as expected.

I like to overthink and make the worst scenarios in my head.

It's exhausting.

Today reading a book about picking up women, I realized a very helpful advice:

Mistakes will happen. Learn and repeat.

It's ok when things don't go to plan. Learn and repeat.

It's ok if your business crumbled. Learn and repeat.

It's ok if your friends are not as you expect. Learn and repeat

Learn and repeat.

Sounds easy.

But it's really not.

Shit, I am overthinking again.

Learn and repeat.
